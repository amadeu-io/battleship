## Features

The app has been built to be very easy to use

**Ship Placements**

- Randomly shuffle ship placements
- Drag & drop for positioning
- Click to switch orientation
- If a ship is placed on an invalid position, instead of throwing an error or not doing anything, the UI cleverly places it in the closest valid position available

**Quick Start**

- Start playing in seconds with just two Enter key presses if you don't care about ship placements

**Visual UI**

- Animations and disctintive colors for the different game events

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** TypeScript, CSS, HTML
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Interaction Dependencies:** interact.js
- **Testing Framework:** Jest

## Directories

- `/src`: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `/src/styles`: CSS styles.
  - `/src/ts/classes`: TypeScript classes.
  - `/src/ts/main.ts`: App functionality, DOM and object manipulation.
- `/docs`: Distribution files generated during the build, used by GitHub pages.

- `/public`: Images, sprites and font.

- `index.html`: Entry point for the Vite app in development with dynamic injection of TypeScript and CSS.

## Classes

The project utilizes several TypeScript classes to organize data and encapsulate functionality

### 1. `Ship` Class:

Represents each individual ship.

**Properties:**

- `name`
- `length`
- `position`
- `orientation`
- `hits`
- `sunk`
- `coordinates`: Computed property

**Methods:**

- `hit()`: Increments the number of hits on the ship

- `isSunk()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the ship is sunk

- `get coordinates()`: Getter method that computes an array of coordinates based on lenght, position and orientation

- `clone()`: Creates a duplicate instance of the `Ship` class with the same properties

### 2. `Player` Class:

Represents each player (player and opponent).

**Properties:**

- `role`: Role of the player.
- `board`: Array of `{ ship: null, hit: false }` objects representing each cell of the player's game board.
- `ships`: Array to store the player's `Ship`s.
- `death`: Boolean flag indicating whether the player has been defeated.

**Main Methods:**

- `placeShip(ship)`: Places a ship on the player's ships array.

- `moveShip(ship, newPosition)`: Changes the position of a ship if valid.

- `switchShipOrientation(ship)`: Switches the orientation of a ship if valid.

- `createAttack(position)`: Creates an attack at the specified position. Updates both the ships and board array.

- `async createDelayedRandomUnrepAttack()`: Creates a delayed random unrepeated attack, used by the computer. The delay improves UX.

- `moveToClosestValidPosition(ship, desiredPosition)`: It's `moveShip` on steroids. If the desired position is not valid, it starts exporing close positions using an exploration range and it places the ship as soon as it finds a valid one. It also returns a boolean indicating if the placement was sucessful.

- `hasLost()`: Returns `true` if all the player's ships are sunk.

- `populateRandomly()`: Randomly populates the player's board with ships, ensuring valid placements.

- `syncShipsToBoard()`: Synchronizes the player's ships array with it's board array.

- `isInvalidPlacement(candidateShip)`: Checks if a ship is in a valid position i.e overlaps with existing ships or goes out of bounds. This method is curucial for the correct functioning of `moveToClosestValidPosition` and `populateRandomly`.
